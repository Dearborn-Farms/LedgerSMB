           There are two options of including a picture in the output:

           1. An external image available from your webserver
              This option has the downside that the webserver and image
              need to remain available for extended periods.

              <img src="https://example.com/logo.png" border="0" height="58">

           2. An image embedded in the invoice itself
              This option has the downside that the invoice file will
              be larger and the HTML source will be less readable, however,
              it eliminates external dependencies, retaining the integrity
              of the invoice, independent of what happens to publicly hosted
              images

              <img src="data:image/png;base64,<-?lsmb dbfile_base64('logo.png') ?->"
                   border="0" height="58">

              Please note that this is dependent on having a file uploaded by
              the name 'logo.png' under "System - Files". Also, when using this
              option, please remove the hyphens from '<-?lsmb' and '?->'; they
              are used to hide the text from the template processor.
